HOW TO RUN:
############################
My code was ran and tested on my Windows 11 x86-64 Laptop and the Ubuntu UOW Capa server, by using the following commands.

g++ ./*.cpp -std=c++17 -Wall -o APE
./APE n m

Please note that you may chain these commands by using && or ; (either with bash or powershell, respectively)
Furthermore, if you are running this on windows the output file will be an executable, so be sure to include that in the second command.
