HOW TO RUN:
############################
My code was ran and tested on my Windows 11 x86-64 Laptop and the Ubuntu UOW Capa server, by using the following commands.

g++ ./*.cpp -std=c++17 -Wall -o ./main
./main Tasks.txt Workers.txt Output.txt

Please note that you may chain these commands by using && or ; (either with bash or powershell, respectively)
Furthermore, if you are running this on windows the output file will be an executable, so be sure to include that in the second command.

FILES:
-------------------------
driver.cpp
This is the main file containing the execution of code, reading of files and outputting to a file.
-------------------------
header.cpp
This contains the bulk of the code, for processing strings and converting them into workers, tasks, and for
calculating performance scores, and task success or failure.
------------------------
header.h
This file contains the prototypes for my functions in header.cpp, constant variables and structs necessary
for the other files.
